# Project_Satillite

## Project Description

The **Project_Satellite** is a comprehensive study aimed at modeling satellite orbits around Earth using MATLAB software. The primary goal of this project is to create a detailed model of Earth and its satellites, along with analyzing their orbital motion.

### Key Components of the Project:

- **Earth Model**: Implementation of a three-dimensional Earth model considering its physical characteristics, such as radius, mass, and shape.
- **Satellite Trajectories**: Simulation of satellite trajectories around Earth, including calculation of their orbital parameters.
- **Motion Analysis**: Study of the dynamics of satellite movement, taking into account Earth's gravity and other factors.

### Technologies and Tools:

- **MATLAB**: Software for mathematical modeling and data analysis, used for implementing algorithms and simulations.
- **3D Graphics**: Utilization of MATLAB functions for visualizing Earth models and satellite trajectories in three dimensions.

### Goals and Tasks:

- Development of an accurate Earth and satellite model.
- Simulation and analysis of satellite trajectory movements.
- Investigation of various parameters' influence on satellite movement.
- Visualization of simulation results for better understanding of the processes involved.
